A recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. It first captures the past behavior of a customer and based on that, recommends products which the users might be likely to buy on Amazon, watch on Netflix or search on Google.

In this article, we will cover various types of recommendation engine algorithms and fundamentals of creating them in Python. We will also see the mathematics behind the workings of these algorithms. Finally, we will create our own recommendation engine

**Collecting Data**
This is the first and most crucial step for building a recommendation engine. The data can be collected by two means: explicitly and implicitly. Explicit data is information that is provided intentionally, i.e. input from the users such as movie ratings. Implicit data is information that is not provided intentionally but gathered from available data streams like search history, clicks, order history, etc.

**Exploring Dataset**:

**Filtering**:
* Content based filtering
* User-User collaborative filtering
* Item-Item collaborative filtering

**Similarities Techniques**:
* Cosine
* Dot Product
* Euclidean Distance
* Pearson's Correlation

**Demo**:
